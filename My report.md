# DEEPTHI's Genral Task Report

## Task 1: 3D Printing


 *I was enthusiastic about starting 3D printing.I mastered the basics of 3D printing,including crucial details of nozzel and bed temperature.I used creality cloud to get STL file of the model and then sliced it to proper dimensions.Then,successfully printed an adorable Pikachu.The picture  of print is given below.*

## Task 2:API

*Initially I learnt about API's and then I created a web weather app using HTML and CSS.I used Open weather API to create this application.This task helped me to get familiarise with HTML and CSS .I faced some problems in activating the API key but then I succeeded in doing it.*

## Task 3: Working with Github

*I created a fork in Spoon-Knife project and then learnt how to clone a fork and cloned it using Gitbash.Then I created my own branch named Deepthianand and then learned to perform some changes in branch.Then I debbuged main.py which was failing test due to "+1" in the code.Then I opened a pull request proposing to fix the issue.*

## Task 4:Getting familiar with the Command line on Ubuntu

*I learnt how command line on ubuntu works.I created a folder named test and created a blank file and listed that file into the folder.Then created 2600 folders in that folder and concatenated 2 text files containing random text and displayed them as shown below.*

## Task 6:Working with Pandas and Matplotlib

*I used Python's Matplotlib and Pandas libraries to plot line graphs, bar graphs, and scatter plots for a random dataset. This helped me to get familiar with these libraries.The  respective plots and their code are as follows.*

## Task 8: Writing Resource Article using Markdown

*I wrote an article on Chandrayan-3,which is a India's lunar exploration mission by ISRO using markdown.Markdown made it easier for me to write this article because of its simplicity. Its straightforward syntax and easy-to-use format allow for a clean and organized presentation. This simplicity not only enhances the writing experience but also ensures the content is accessible and visually appealing to readers.*

## Task 9:Tinkercad

*I created my account in tinkercad and got familiarized to design circuits.Then I designed a circuit to estimate distance between an obstacle within range and the sensor using an ultrasonic sensor and simulated it and displayed on serial monitor.The circuit and tinkercad link as follows.*

## Task 10: Speed Control Of DC Motor

*I designed a circuit using UNO,DC Motor and H-Bridge L298N motor driver and simulated it on Tinkercad [(Link to Tinkercad simulation)](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/4FzdqNARZr8-speed-control?sharecode=CLxPsbXmZxomCNyuH6fC524ZjcrhyIlj2J_r1-6-cXE).Then I made a hardware circuit using UNO,DC Motor,H-Bridge L298N motor driver and potentiometer and then uploaded the code to UNO and then controlled the DC Motor using potentiometer.*

## Task 13:555 IC Multivibrator

*Got familiarized with IC and several pins of IC and duty cycles in 555 IC.Then built a 555 IC Multivibrator circuit for 60% duty cycle .Used capacitors of desired value but due to unavailability of desired resistors ,used nearest resistor and got 56% duty cycle on oscilloscope.*
